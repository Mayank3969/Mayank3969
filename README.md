## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Computer Science undergraduate** who enjoys turning ideas into **working, efficient systems**.  
My current focus is on building strong fundamentals in **problem-solving, software development, and data analysis**, with a growing interest in **Machine Learning and applied AI**.

I value **clarity over shortcuts** — understanding *why* something works before optimizing *how*. I prefer learning by building real projects, refining them iteratively, and writing code that is both **correct and maintainable**.

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Core **Machine Learning fundamentals**
- Mathematical intuition behind ML & DL models  
- Improving problem-solving skills using **C++**
- Writing cleaner, more structured Python code

## 🧩 Projects

| Project | Description | Tech |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **File Compressor** | Implemented a file compression tool using **Huffman Encoding**, achieving up to **~40% reduction** in storage for text files. Focused on correctness, memory efficiency, and algorithmic clarity. | C++ |
| **Website Blocker for Windows** | Built a Windows utility that blocks websites by managing IPs and direct URL rules. Handles dynamic IP changes by combining **IP fetching** and **direct URL blocking** techniques. | Python |

🔗 **Repositories**  
- File Compressor → https://github.com/Mayank3969/File-Compress  
- Website Blocker → https://github.com/Mayank3969/ip-blocker  

> I prioritize **few well-understood projects** over many shallow ones.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

> *When I try to write lazy code, I often end up optimizing it by accident.*
